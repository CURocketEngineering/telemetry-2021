### Issues
The pip package for digi-xbee has had some issues lately.
If you get errors on the import, change line 230 of 
`telemetry-env/lib/python3.9/site-packages/digi/xbee/models/mode.py`
from 
`return sum(op.code for op in options if lambda option: option != cls.EXPLICIT)`
to
`return sum(op.code for op in options if op < cls.UNSUPPORTED_ZDO_PASSTHRU)`.
